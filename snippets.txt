Added this here incase the info.plist issue pops up again so I don't have to go track it down.

in config.xml
<config-file parent="NSCameraUsageDescription" target="*-Info.plist">
    <string>need camera access to take pictures</string>
</config-file>
<config-file parent="NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" target="*-Info.plist">
    <string>need photo library access to get pictures from there</string>
</config-file>
